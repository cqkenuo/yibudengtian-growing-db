# Cross-site scripting  
In this section, we'll explain what cross-site scripting is, describe the different varieties of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and spell out how to find and prevent cross-site scripting.  

# What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?  
Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.  

# How does XSS work?  
Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

# What are the types of XSS attacks?  
There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:  
1:Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.  
2:Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.  
3:DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.  

# Reflected cross-site scripting  
Reflected XSS is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.  

Here is a simple example of a reflected XSS vulnerability:  

https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.  

<p>Status: All is well.</p>  

The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily construct an attack like this:  

https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>  

<p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>  

If the user visits the URL constructed by the attacker, then the attacker's script executes in the user's browser, in the context of that user's session with the application. At that point, the script can carry out any action, and retrieve any data, to which the user has access.  

# Stored cross-site scripting  
Stored XSS (also known as persistent or second-order XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.  

The data in question might be submitted to the application via HTTP requests; for example, comments on a blog post, user nicknames in a chat room, or contact details on a customer order. In other cases, the data might arrive from other untrusted sources; for example, a webmail application displaying messages received over SMTP, a marketing application displaying social media posts, or a network monitoring application displaying packet data from network traffic.  

Here is a simple example of a stored XSS vulnerability. A message board application lets users submit messages, which are displayed to other users:  

<p>Hello, this is my message!</p>  

The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily send a message that attacks other users:  

<p><script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>
